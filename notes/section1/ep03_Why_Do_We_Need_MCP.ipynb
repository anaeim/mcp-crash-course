    "the cool thing is that we can implement an MCP server to any logic we want. And effectively we're now giving our agents, our AI agents, the capability to do everything, so we're not bounded by any implementation. All we need to do is to implement the MCP protocol and all the client that support MCP is going to be able to run those functionality."
